This improved version avoids the race condition by using local variables and removing the reliance on a global variable:

```php
<?php

function processFile($filename) {
  // Process file data locally
  $fileData = file($filename);
  return $fileData;
}

// Example usage
$data1 = processFile('file1.txt');
$data2 = processFile('file2.txt');

// Now you have separate data arrays for each file

print_r($data1);
print_r($data2);

?>
```

By eliminating the global variable, each call to `processFile` operates on its own copy of the data, preventing concurrent modification and race conditions.
